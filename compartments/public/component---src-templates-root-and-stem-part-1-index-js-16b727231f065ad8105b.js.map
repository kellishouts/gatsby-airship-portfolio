It may all be behind the scenes, though <b>I enjoy designing systems that are maintainable for both managers and developers</b>. As a product owner myself, I wouldn't want to spend resources to pay for text updates that could only be implemented by developers due to technical constraints. Similarly, developers don't want to be doing the equivalent of data entry.  I believe that any infrastructure that allows content to be decoupled from code streamlines processes, keeps things sustainable, and most importantly, ensures that everyone on a project team is utilized in the areas of their expertise.</p>\n\n              <h4>A Typical Project Plan</h4>\n              <p>Visualized in a chart, a \"typical\" project probably looks like this:</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - TIMELINE FOR REGULAR DEV</p>\n\n              <p>The result is lower-cost initial development with a long cycle of content revisions prior to launch and somewhat costly incremental revisions post-launch. This plan is perfectly fine, and possibly preferable, for a product that is likely to undergo systemic changes post-launch. It wouldn't make sense to invest resources in robust management infrastructure.</p>\n\n              <h4>This Project Plan</h4>\n              <p>I enjoy designing an infrastructure that is robust and allows for product owners and content creators to maintain their product for a longer period following initial development:</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - TIMELINE FOR AIRSHIP DEV</p>\n\n              <p>The result is more costly initial development, an efficient content update cycle decoupled from code, and a reduction of maintenance costs post-launch. This structure makes sense for a product that doesn't have plans to undergo systemic changes in the short to medium term (1 - 2 years), yet needs the flexibility to be extend and configure data within the constraints of the system architecture.</p>\n\n              <p className=\"centered\">* * *</p>\n              <p><b>Part 2</b> (coming soon) explains how I add a thematic layer to the project and integrate that theme into a dynamic data visualization.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n    </Layout >\n  )\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
