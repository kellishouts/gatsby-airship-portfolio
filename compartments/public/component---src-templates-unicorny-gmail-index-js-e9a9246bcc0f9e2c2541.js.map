I'm a huge fan of Inbox, and was devastated to think that I would have to fall back to Gmail. Additionally, I didn't really want the heavy experience of desktop email clients like Mac Mail or Outlook.</p>\n              <p>So I decided to hack my own browser to improve the UI of Gmail, and wrote about my process in a blog post, which you can read <a href=\"https://medium.com/@airshipcms/gmail-ux-sucks-so-i-fixed-it-for-my-own-sanity-b6f33898ebe3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n              \n              <div className=\"image-box image-box-large\">\n                <img className=\"large-image\" src=\"https://kelli.airshipcms.io/assets/images/unicorny-gmail.gif\" alt=\"Unicorny Gmail\" />\n                <p className=\"caption\">Before and after UI Hacks</p>\n              </div>\n\n              <p>The blog post was featured on Medium's front page and received about 1.5k \"claps\" in March 2019 when it was initially published. Somehow, natural traffic caused a second spike on January 5, 2020, and at the end of January 2020, the post was up to 3.9k total \"claps.\" Additionally, the Design Editor of Medium.com's Design Blog, <em>Modus</em> reached out to me to ask if they could publish the article in their permanent featured collection. To date, it has received over 80k views!</p>\n\n              <p>I also took this project a step further, and figured out how to wrap my CSS code to be an actual Chrome Browser extension, which I published <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorny-gmail/pmffbbfjmlgobdognnccbkieanlkkjjk?authuser=2\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> so you can download and install it into Chrome (if you use Gmail).</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n      </div>\n    </Layout >\n  )\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
