With this in mind, we <b>stripped out 75% of the digital game UI functionality.</b></p>\n              <p>We also <b>simplified the rules</b> and user roles. Originally, we had created the roles of Captain, Chief Analyst, Commander, and Engineer. In practice, the separation of roles made things complex and negatively impacted gameplay. Omitting this complication made it easier to scale the game to larger group sizes.</p>\n              <div className=\"image-box image-box-large\">\n                {/* <img onClick={openLightLightbox(\"https://kelli.airshipcms.io/assets/images/sketch-v2-all-screens-small.png\")} className=\"large-image\" src=\"https://kelli.airshipcms.io/assets/images/sketch-v2-all-screens-small.png\" alt=\"Four separate user flows were simplified to a single flow in the game UI.\" /> */}\n                <a href=\"https://kelli.airshipcms.io/assets/images/sketch-v2-all-screens-small.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img className=\"large-image\" src=\"https://kelli.airshipcms.io/assets/images/sketch-v2-all-screens-small.png\" alt=\"Four separate user flows were simplified to a single flow in the game UI.\" /></a>\n                <p className=\"caption\">Four separate user flows were simplified to a single flow in the game UI.</p>\n              </div>\n              <p>Randy had noted that there would only be 1 hour available to play the game.
