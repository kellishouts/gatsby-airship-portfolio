I have witnessed so many projects where content change requests end up wasting 80% of a developer's time.

However, coming from a visual design / product background, I am always thinking about how we can better engage our audience. I pitched the idea of <b>strong infographics</b> as a focal point to attract visitors and gain more traction through the rest of the web application. This would ideally also give those browsing for leisure more of a reason to engage with content.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - FLOWCHART OF USER DRIVEN BY INFOGRAPHICS FOCAL POINT</p>\n\n              <p>The user flows mapped to the following web components: Programs, Contributors, Programs Admin, and Map. Each component is described below.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container white-container\">\n          <div className=\"block\">\n            <div className=\"project-section\">\n              <h3>Programs</h3>\n              {/* <p>The user flows mapped to the following web components:</p> */}\n\n              {/* <h4>Programs</h4> */}\n              <p>The Programs section pulled all STEM Programs data from Firebase and rendered it as a searchable, filterable list. I studied several similar websites and noticed that they all had very complex filtering and search capabilities. Since this was the site’s first iteration and there were less than 200 initial programs, I limited the filters to properties that would return the most general results: Program Type, Age Group, Industry, and Region.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - PROGRAMS</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container very-light-grey-container\">\n          <div className=\"block\">\n            <div className=\"project-section\">\n\n              <h3>Contributors</h3>\n              <p>I structured the Contributors interface to be a simple and straightforward. Users could sign up, set up an organization, then fill out a 3-step form to submit a STEM Program. Once submitted, the program was set to a “Pending” status to be reviewed by a site administrator.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - SUBMIT A PROGRAM</p>\n\n              <p>Despite its simple appearance, the Contributors UI was complex and robust under the hood. All form questions in the program submission flow mapped to data fields in Airship CMS. These fields could be modified and new fields could even be added via the CMS, without having to interrupt the developer's workflow.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - DIAGRAM OF AIRSHIP TO WEB APP FORM FIELDS</p>\n\n              <p>I had designed a complex data structure that mapped form field types to CMS-managed content. This allowed me (and future content admins) the flexibility to update the exact text for fields and options asynchronously from the developer working on the web application infrastructure.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - ALL DATA TYPES (MAYBE GH TICKET?)</p>\n              \n              <p>In also meant that we could reduce development time and stack processes that usually need to occur in sequence.</p>\n\n              <p>PIC - GANTT CHART COMPARISON</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"container white-container\">\n          <div className=\"block\">\n            <div className=\"project-section\">\n\n              <h3>Programs Admin</h3>\n\n              <p>The Programs Admin interface allowed admins to log in and review pending STEM programs.
